                    Hello Learners, 
                </h3>
                <p>
                This blog has to do with online learning via Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCS). Nowadays, lifelong learning is the best way to stay up to date with technology. Self-learning has special importance in terms of acquiring the necessary skills in our contemporary work environment. Some years ago I recognized that there was a potential in MOOCS and non-traditional education, especially if somebody tries to enrich a Curriculum vitae. With high rated specific online courses it is possible to obtain skills equivalent to a Bachelor’s degree or a master’s degree. In addition to MOOC certificates and how somebody can upload them in Linked in and other social media and platforms there is one big fact and the most important: The practical skills that employers love. In my case, my "nukes" in various interviews where the online courses in combination with work experience. A university degree is a proof of academic progress while continuous learning is an indication of personal and professional growth. Generally speaking it is not a good practice to underestimate traditional learning or omit to make an effort to learn something after the degree.
